# Skin-disease-dectection-using-ResNet-152-and-web-app-with-Flask-ngrok
This study developed an automated system to classify four common inflammatory skin diseases with similar morphological and color features including eczema, psoriasis, actinic keratosis, and severe acne based on a deep learning platform. The study used 5433 images for four diseases taken from the SD-260 and Dermnet datasets. The deep learning model developed in this study was a customized ResNet152 model. The deep learning model developed in this study gave better than 89% accuracy results. Finally, we built a web application capable of automatically classifying skin diseases with the integrated model developed. This study shows that deep learning has great potential for the accurate classification of skin diseases and strongly develops teledermatology to support disease diagnosis.
